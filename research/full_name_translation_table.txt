If you retrieve the schedule from KronoX in XML with parameter
"forklaringar=true" in the query string you will get a table at the
end, with mappings from ID to full names. It seems a bit poorly
updated though: K3LARA translates to Lars Rauer? Must be an old
name. At least the course names seem correct, as these are the same
that you search for.

However, when you retrieve the same schedule from KronoX in iCal
format with this parameter, the information is not there. I guess
there is no place to put this data in the iCal file format. Lars spoke
to the us about getting this full name data from Kursdatabasen. Could
that be possible?
